	<h2 id="about">What this all about?</h2>
	<p>
		Shamelessly inspired by <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">The Million Dollar Homepage</a>,
		FamousNameus is a straight-forward forum to value your name or title. By outbidding current title, your title
		will replace the current leader on the <a href="/">home page</a>. Advertisers, individuals or anyone with a
		valuable name has a chance to claim a spot in internet history.
	</p>

	<h2 id="who">Who are you?</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Jonathan, and I'm a Software Engineer from San Francisco. You can
		<a href="http://twitter.com/azoff">follow my twitter</a>, or send me a direct
		message to get in touch.
	</p>

	<h2 id="real">Is this for real?</h2>
	<p>
		While the satire is not lost on me, I am very serious about maintaining and updating this site. In a way, it's
		my experiment into the human mind, implied value, and artificial scarcity. If you have any questions or
		concerns, please don't be afraid to contact me. Enjoy it, have fun, and leave feedback.
	</p>

	<h2 id="idea">How did you come up with the idea?</h2>
	<p>
		Human psychology intrigues me, and so does its applications on the web. The scale of the internet, coupled with
		its potentially unlimited source of creativity, are just too compelling to ignore. Enough nights of falling
		asleep and thinking about this problem, translates into what you see today. I launched FamousNameus in
		September of 2012, after a few nights and weekends worth of work. I've been maintaining it ever since.
	</p>

	<h2 id="money">What will you do with the money?</h2>
	<p>
		For the most part, any money this site makes will be used to fund the cost of the servers. Assuming FamousNameus
		ever turns a profit, the proceeds will be used to fund new features of the site. For some ideas about what those
		may be, check out <a href="#future">the future ideas section</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="why">Why should I pay to display my title?</h2>
	<p>
		The way I see it, the best argument for paying is not about necessity, but desire. I don't think anyone *should*
		need to pay, so much as I think that there are those who may *want* to. Got something to say, something to
		advertise, or simply just curious - then you probably want to pay to play.
	</p>

	<h2 id="#guarantee">How long will the site be online?</h2>
	<p>
		As long as I can afford to run it. All revenue that comes in through FamousNameus is directly repurposed to keep
		the site running. In the short-to-medium term, I understand that it is unreasonable to assume that it can run on
		income alone. As a result, I guarantee to keep it up and running for three years after launch. That means you
		can expect it to exist, without profit, until September of 2015. However, that is truly a worst-case scenario,
		and I fully expect the service to outlive the deadline.
	</p>

	<h2 id="#future">What is the future of FamousNameus?</h2>
	<p>
		While it's hard to hypothesize about all the things I can do with FamousNameus, I do have some short-term
		ideas. The most obvious next step is adding an interface to historical data. That way, payers won't be left
		high and dry if a new payer out bids them. At the very least, they can see why and by how much they lost
		out by. I also want to expose some of my metrics, so that payers can see what type of exposure their names
		get. More to come, keep tuned in and suggest features by <a href="http://twitter.com">commenting on twitter</a>.
